# PBA Jam
## Python Basketball Association
This program utilizes pygame to simulate a 1 vs 1 basketball game between two users to 21 points.

To run this game, download the files and run the main() function located in the main.py file by typing `python main.py` in the console. This will open a window and start the game's character selection screen. After both players have selected their player of choice with the mouse, the game will start with player 1 having the ball. Now you're ready to hoop!
